* These executable binaries are built for **x86_64** architecture only.
* The MacOS version may not work with Apple Silicon, even with Rosetta. There might be some issues with the Docker in the host.
* The Windows version, though provided, is still not recommended and is not a classic use case. We **recommend** to use the Windows Subsystems for Linux (WSL).
