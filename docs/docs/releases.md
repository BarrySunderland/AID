[Generic Linux](https://dl.bintray.com/autoai/AID/aid-Ubuntu)

[Mac OS X](https://dl.bintray.com/autoai/AID/aid-macOS)

Our build pipeline is build only on latest versions of Ubuntu and Mac OS X, if you are encounter problems in running the edge version, please tell us and we will improve the pipeline. To save your time, you can also build AID on your own platform with certain version of ```Golang``` and ```gcc```.

### Note for Windows Users

Currently, we have no idea on how to let A.I.D edge version run on windows, as our pipeline cannot support it. For Windows users, please consider use ```Windows Subsystem for Linux``` or build it by yourself.
